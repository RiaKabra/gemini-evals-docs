# Improving Evaluation Documentation for Gemini APIs â€“ GSoC 2025

This is my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 project proposal with Google DeepMind. The goal of this project is to expand documentation, tutorials, and code examples that help researchers and developers evaluate Google's Gemini models using tools like `promptfoo`, `wandb`, and other LLM eval frameworks.
